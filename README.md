# ImageToAscii

Convert your images into ASCII art.

## Installation:

- Clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/codyaal/ImageToAscii.git
```

- If you have `vscode` run the app using the `live server` extension, or open the `index.html` file using a browser.
- or simply if you just want to quickly try the app, just click on the link in the **about** section of the repo.

## Usage:

- Upload a picture by clicking on the `Upload` button, when the image is loaded the ASCII art will appear on the drawing board.
- Change the `font` or `background` color using the respective color pickers on the side bar.
- Change the resolution of the ASCII art using the range slider under the `Resolution` section on the side bar (max = 256, min = 16, step = 16), this resolution controls the height of the output so the width will be higher in landcape photos.
- Change the ASCII characters used as shades in the `Ascii shades` section on the side bar (up to 16 characters).

## Demo:
